⚙️ Overview

The Life Admin Dashboard is my personal life management system built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s a dark, futuristic dashboard inspired by Tesla’s clean UI.
The project helps me visualize and organize my daily schedule, combining technology, productivity, and personal growth in one powerful digital space.

The dashboard includes:

A live digital clock that displays real-time updates

A full daily schedule including:

Web Development (10h)

English Zoom Project (4h)

Tech Reading (1h)

Podcast Creation (1h)

English Grammar Practice (1h)

Exercise (1h)

Meditation & Visualization (1h)

Sleep (4h)

Work / Homework (1h)

A Sunday review section for reflection and family connection

Tesla-inspired dark mode design with neon blue highlights

Every second that passes on this dashboard reminds me that time is energy — and energy must be directed toward purpose.
